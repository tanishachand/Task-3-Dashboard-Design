•Risk Segmentation: Breaks down approval performance across essential groups, including Income Tiers and Credit Score Bins (Poor/Fair/Good).
•Performance Comparison: Uses a Matrix Heat Map to quickly identify high- and low-performing combinations of City and Income Group.
Technical Features

•DAX: Implemented the custom Approval Rate measure.
•Design: Employs a clean, top-to-bottom hierarchy with efficient Dropdown Slicers and Conditional Formatting for instant insights.
